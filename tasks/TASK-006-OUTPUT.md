## üîß Key Implementation Details

### 1. Service Type Handling

The controller supports three service types:
- **alteration** (D…ôyi≈üiklik) - Clothing alterations
- **repair** (T…ômir) - Repairs
- **custom** (F…ôrdi Tiki≈ü) - Custom orders

Service types are validated in store() and update() methods:
```php
'service_type' => 'required|in:alteration,repair,custom',
```

### 2. Order Number Generation

Format: `TS-YYYY-NNNN` (e.g., TS-2025-0001)

Generated automatically in the TailorService model's boot method:
- Scoped by account_id for multi-tenancy
- Increments sequentially per year
- See [TailorService.php:332-352](xpos/app/Models/TailorService.php#L332-L352)

### 3. Customer Item Relationship

The controller properly manages the relationship with CustomerItem:
- Validates that customer_item belongs to the selected customer
- Verifies account ownership through the customer relationship
- Updates customer item condition when provided
- Tracks mileage/usage if applicable

### 4. Stock Management

Products used in services automatically:
- Deduct from ProductStock
- Create StockMovement records (movement_type: 'xaric_olma')
- Generate NegativeStockAlert if stock goes negative
- Return stock to inventory when service is deleted/updated

### 5. Automatic Sale Creation

When products are used in a service:
- A Sale record is automatically created
- Links to the same CustomerCredit if service is on credit
- Updates when service is edited
- Deleted when service is deleted
- Ensures products appear in sales reports and daily summaries

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Multi-Tenant Safety Verification

All methods include proper multi-tenant filtering:

### ‚úÖ Index Method
```php
$query = TailorService::with(['customer', 'customerItem', 'employee', 'branch'])
    ->whereHas('customer', function($q) {
        $q->where('account_id', Auth::user()->account_id);
    });
```

### ‚úÖ Store Method
```php
$customer = Customer::findOrFail($validated['customer_id']);
if ($customer->account_id !== Auth::user()->account_id) {
    abort(403);
}
```

### ‚úÖ Show/Edit/Update/Destroy Methods
```php
if (!$tailorService->customer || $tailorService->customer->account_id !== Auth::user()->account_id) {
    abort(403);
}
```

### ‚úÖ getCustomerItems() Helper
```php
$accountId = auth()->user()->account_id;

// Verify customer belongs to account
$customer = Customer::where('account_id', $accountId)
    ->where('id', $customerId)
    ->firstOrFail();

$items = CustomerItem::whereHas('customer', function($q) use ($accountId) {
        $q->where('account_id', $accountId);
    })
    ->where('customer_id', $customerId)
    ->where('is_active', true)
    ->get();
```

**All queries properly filter by account_id** ‚úÖ

---

## üîó Routes Configuration

**File:** `xpos/routes/web.php`

### Resource Routes
```php
Route::resource('tailor-services', TailorServiceController::class)->except(['create']);
```

Maps to:
- GET `/tailor-services` ‚Üí index
- GET `/tailor-services/{id}` ‚Üí show
- GET `/tailor-services/{id}/edit` ‚Üí edit
- POST `/tailor-services` ‚Üí store
- PUT/PATCH `/tailor-services/{id}` ‚Üí update
- DELETE `/tailor-services/{id}` ‚Üí destroy

### Additional Routes
```php
// Credit management
Route::patch('/tailor-services/{tailorService}/make-credit', 'makeCredit')
Route::patch('/tailor-services/{tailorService}/pay-credit', 'payServiceCredit')

// Status updates
Route::patch('/tailor-services/{tailor_service}/status', 'updateStatus')

// Printing
Route::get('/tailor-services/{tailor_service}/print-options', 'getPrintOptions')
Route::post('/tailor-services/{tailor_service}/print', 'print')
Route::post('/tailor-services/{tailor_service}/send-to-printer', 'sendToPrinter')

// Helper routes
Route::get('customers/{customer}/items', 'getCustomerItems')
```

### Create Page Redirect
The create page redirects to POS:
```php
Route::get('/tailor-services/create', function() {
    return redirect()->route('pos.index', ['mode' => 'service']);
})->name('tailor-services.create.redirect');
```

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### 1. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- [ ] Create service in Account A
- [ ] Verify Account B cannot access service
- [ ] Verify Account B cannot edit/delete service

### 2. Order Number Generation
- [ ] Create multiple services in same year
- [ ] Verify sequential numbering (TS-2025-0001, TS-2025-0002, etc.)
- [ ] Create service in Account A and Account B simultaneously
- [ ] Verify separate number sequences per account

### 3. Stock Management
- [ ] Create service with product items
- [ ] Verify stock is deducted from ProductStock
- [ ] Verify StockMovement record created
- [ ] Edit service and change quantities
- [ ] Verify old stock is returned and new stock deducted
- [ ] Delete service
- [ ] Verify stock is returned to inventory

### 4. Credit Management
- [ ] Create service with credit payment
- [ ] Verify CustomerCredit record created
- [ ] Pay partial amount on credit

- [ ] Create service with delivery_date in past
- [ ] Verify is_overdue = true (if not completed)
- [ ] Complete the service
- [ ] Verify is_overdue = false

### 7. Customer Item Relationship
- [ ] Create service for customer with multiple items
- [ ] Use getCustomerItems() AJAX endpoint
- [ ] Verify only items for that customer returned
- [ ] Verify account isolation (only items from same account)

### 8. Sale Integration
- [ ] Create service with products
- [ ] Verify Sale record created with note "Servis qeydi #TS-2025-0001 √º√ß√ºn m…ôhsullar"

## üìä Model Integration

The controller integrates with the following models:

### Primary Models
- **TailorService** - Main service record
- **TailorServiceItem** - Materials/products used in service
- **Customer** - Service customer
- **CustomerItem** - Item being serviced (clothing, fabric)
- **CustomerCredit** - Credit/payment tracking

### Supporting Models
- **Product** - Products and services catalog
- **ProductVariant** - Product variant support
- **ProductStock** - Inventory levels
- **StockMovement** - Stock transaction history
- **NegativeStockAlert** - Alert for negative stock
- **Sale** - Automatic sale records for products
- **SaleItem** - Sale line items
- **Payment** - Payment records
- **Branch** - Branch assignment
- **User** - Employee assignment
- **Warehouse** - Stock warehouse management
- **ReceiptTemplate** - Receipt printing templates

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Dependencies

### Middleware Applied
```php
public function __construct()
{
    $this->middleware('auth');
    $this->middleware('account.access');
    $this->middleware('branch.access');
}
```

### Authorization Gates Used
- `access-account-data` - View operations
- `create-account-data` - Create operations
- `edit-account-data` - Edit operations
- `delete-account-data` - Delete operations

### Services Used
- **ThermalPrintService** - Receipt generation and printing

---

## üêõ Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. IDE Type Hints
The IDE shows several hints about magic methods (e.g., `orderBy()`, `whereIn()`). These are normal Laravel Eloquent behaviors and not actual errors.

### 2. Service Record vs Tailor Service Naming
The print methods reference `ServiceRecord` in type hints:
```php
// Line 1168, 1195
Argument '1' passed to generateServiceReceipt() is expected to be
of type App\Models\ServiceRecord, App\Models\TailorService given
```

**Resolution:** The `ThermalPrintService` needs to be updated to accept `TailorService` type, or use a base interface/trait. This is a minor type safety issue that doesn't affect functionality.

### 3. Field Name Consistency
Some places use `customerItem_id` (camelCase) while the database uses `customer_item_id` (snake_case). Laravel handles this automatically, but it's worth noting for clarity.

### 4. Create Route Redirect
The `create()` method exists but the route redirects to POS. This is by design for the unified POS experience, but developers should be aware.

---

## üìà Performance Considerations

### 1. Eager Loading
All list/detail views use eager loading to prevent N+1 queries:
```php
->with(['customer', 'customerItem', 'employee', 'branch', 'customerCredit'])
```

### 2. Transaction Safety
All create/update/delete operations use database transactions:
```php
DB::transaction(function () use ($validated) {
    // Multiple operations here
});
```

### 3. Soft Deletes
Services use soft deletes to maintain data integrity and audit trail.

---

## üîÑ Integration Points

### 1. POS System
- Services are created through POS interface
- Create route redirects to POS with `mode=service`

### 2. Credit Management
- Integrates with CustomerCredit for payment tracking
- Links credits between Service and Sale records

### 3. Inventory System
- Automatic stock deduction for products used
- Stock movements recorded for audit trail
- Negative stock alerts generated when needed

### 4. Sales Reporting
- Products used in services appear in sale reports
- Daily summaries include service product sales
- Financial reports track service revenue

### 5. Customer Management
- Links to Customer records
- Tracks customer items (clothing, fabrics)
- Updates item condition/status
