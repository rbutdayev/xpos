## 📝 Field Mapping

| OLD (Previous Controller) | NEW (Updated Controller) |
|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| description | item_description |
| fabric_type | fabric |
| measurements | (removed) |
| reference_number | (removed) |
| received_date | (removed) |
| is_active | (removed) |
| account_id (manual set) | (removed - handled by model) |
| - | size (NEW) |
| - | purchase_date (NEW) |
| - | special_instructions (NEW) |

## ✅ Multi-Tenant Safety Verified

- [x] All methods use `getAccountId()` helper
- [x] All queries use `forAccount()` scope
- [x] Customer ownership verified before operations
- [x] Item scoped through customer's account
- [x] TailorServices relationship filtered by account_id
- [x] No direct CustomerItem::find() without scoping

---

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test 1: Create Customer Item
```bash
POST /customer-items
{
  "customer_id": 1,
  "item_type": "Jacket",
  "fabric": "Wool",
  "size": "L",
  "color": "Navy Blue",
  "item_description": "Winter jacket",
  "special_instructions": "Handle with care"
}
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Item created and redirected to show page

### Test 2: Multi-Tenant Scoping
- Create item for Account A customer
- Attempt to access from Account B
- **Expected Result:** ✅ 404 Not Found (access denied)

### Test 3: Delete Protection
- Create item with tailor services
- Attempt to delete item
- **Expected Result:** ✅ Error message "Cannot delete item with N associated tailor service(s)"

### Test 4: Search Functionality
```bash
GET /customer-items/search?q=Jacket
```
**Expected Result:** ✅ Returns only items matching search, scoped to current account

### Test 5: Filter by Type
```bash
GET /customer-items?type=Jacket
```
**Expected Result:** ✅ Returns only Jacket type items

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### Response Key Changes (Frontend may need updates)
- Index: `customerItems` → `items`
- Show: `customerItem` → `item`
- Edit: `customerItem` → `item`

### Field Name Changes (Forms need updates)
- `description` → `item_description`
- `fabric_type` → `fabric`

### Removed Fields (Forms need updates)
- `measurements` (array)
- `reference_number`
- `received_date`
- `is_active`
- `account_id` (no longer manually set)

### Added Fields (Forms should include)
- `size`
- `purchase_date`
- `special_instructions`

### Method Signature Changes
Changed from route model binding to integer ID:
- `show(CustomerItem $customerItem)` → `show(int $id)`
- `edit(CustomerItem $customerItem)` → `edit(int $id)`
- `update(Request $request, CustomerItem $customerItem)` → `update(Request $request, int $id)`
- `destroy(CustomerItem $customerItem)` → `destroy(int $id)`

**Note:** Routes should be updated if using route model binding. Current routes may need to be checked.

## 🚀 Next Steps

This task is now **COMPLETE** and ready for:

1. **Frontend Updates** - Update Inertia components to:
   - Use new response keys (`items` instead of `customerItems`)
   - Use new field names (`item_description`, `fabric`, `size`, etc.)
   - Add size, purchase_date, special_instructions fields to forms
   - Remove old fields (measurements, reference_number, received_date, is_active)
   - Display itemTypes dropdown in create/edit forms

2. **Route Verification** - Check if routes use route model binding and need updates

3. **Testing** - Run comprehensive tests on all CRUD operations

4. **Database Migration** - If database schema needs updates to match field names
